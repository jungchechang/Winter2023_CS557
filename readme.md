# CS 457 - Computer Graphics Shaders

Here is a summary of my projects from the CS 457 - Computer Graphics Shaders course, taught by Dr. Mike Bailey. During this course, I explored different types of shaders, including vertex, tessellation, geometry, fragment, and compute shaders. I applied these concepts by creating various shader effects and techniques, utilizing C++ alongside OpenGL and GLSL for implementation.
